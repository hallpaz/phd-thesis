\subsection{Network Initialization}

- 1D experiment: Show how the network converges to a filtered version of the signal when initialized with low frequencies. Show the Fourier transform plot.
- 1D experiment: Show how the network diverges when initialized with very high frequencies.

- Studies of Siren Initialization
