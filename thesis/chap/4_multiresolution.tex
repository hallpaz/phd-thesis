\subsection{Signal Reconstruction from Multiresolution Representations }

We leverage the knowledge from sinusoidal networks initialization and multiresolution theory to devise a multi-stage architecture for neural networks. 

- Show how it is possible to reconstruct a signal from the Gaussian Pyramid using regular sampling.

- \red{TODO: Show how it is possible to reconstruct a signal from the Laplacian Pyramid using regular sampling.}

- Argument that we could build S-Net for completeness, which would be equivalent to a shallow sinusoidal network such as Bacon.

- Show that multi-stages neural networks are equivalent to deep sinusoidal neural networks.
